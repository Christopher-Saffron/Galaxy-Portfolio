# Hello there!
## The "Galaxy" Portfolio

Yes, I'm aware Galaxy means not just our Heliocentric System, but "Galaxy Portfolio" sounds way more impressive than a word ordinary people don't use on daily basis.

This is a simple website for everyone, including me, to have a quick access to all of my works. Simple and straight-forward.

Realized first in FIGMA, then developed with all the necessary tools :)
